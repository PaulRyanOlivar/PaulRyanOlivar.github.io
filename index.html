<div style = "top: 100px; margin: 0 auto; bottom: 500 px;
  width: 400px;text-align:center; postion:fixed; top:100px;">
We were born children of God <br>
From birth to death, we live through the human experience<br>
<br>
We were also born to make something of ourselves<br>
and to pursue lives of elegance<br>
<br>
There’s a race to gaining the most money or getting the highest grade<br>
Life is nothing but an instance to compete<br>
<br>
What, then is the meaning of life?<br>
All we are concerned about is wealth to make it complete<br>
<br>
It’s an endless cycle of: Work! Work! Work!<br>
It’s what we make of everything under the heavens<br>
<br>
But we must face the reality<br>
that we all face the fate of death and our work is impermanent <br>
Instead, we must live a fruitful life of joy<br>
For God has given us the freedom to enjoy the things he’s given us<br>
<br>
We must break free of the life vanity<br>
And make time to enjoy God’s gifts before we turn to dust<br>
<br>
